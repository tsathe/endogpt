    "Assistant: I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter. Given their history of nodules increasing in size and tracheal deviation, \n",
    "I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This approach is recommended in patients with bilateral nodular disease who may\n",
    "prefer to undergo one definitive surgery.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, they will require postoperative surveillance, which may include measurement of thyroglobulin to monitor for any residual or\n",
    "recurrent disease, and follow-up with periodic neck ultrasound. If the patient is found to have thyroid cancer postoperatively,\n",
    "further treatment options, such as radioactive iodine ablation, may need to be considered based on the final histopathologic findings\n",
    "and staging. Regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence or the development of symptoms, as well as surveillance ultrasounds and thyroid\n",
    "function tests to ensure euthyroid status, will also be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: I liked that the GPT picked up on the tracheal deviation and that it correctly factored into the decision making. However, The GPT response\n",
    "didn't indicate whether this was a toxic versus nontoxic multinodular goiter. An important part of the clinical decision making is understanding\n",
    "whether the nodule is functional, so this was a glaring omission in the diagnosis. The GPT also did not suggest CT imaging to evaluate the extent of\n",
    "the goiter. Preoperative work up should include evaluating the anatomy, sometimes the ultrasound is sufficient but for large goiters especially\n",
    "those with compressive symptoms and tracheal deviation you want to get a CT scan to evaluate the extent of the goiter (both sub-sternal extent and\n",
    "also its posterior extent). You should suggest additional imaging if the case suggests possible substernal extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: \n",
    "Assistant: I believe that our patient has recurrent papillary thyroid cancer. Given their raised thyroglobulin levels from 0.1 to 1.1,\n",
    "confirmed papillary thyroid cancer in at least one lymph node by fine-needle aspiration, ultrasound findings indicating disease progression,\n",
    "and a history of thyroidectomy with postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, I believe that they would benefit from a lymph node\n",
    "dissection to manage the persistent/recurrent disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, they will require close surveillance with neck ultrasounds and measurements of thyroglobulin levels to monitor for further disease\n",
    "activity or response to treatment. The potential use of repeat PET-CT and/or other imaging modalities should be considered, based on the dynamics\n",
    "of thyroglobulin level changes and clinical judgment. Repeat RAI therapy may also be discussed depending on the extent of the recurrent disease\n",
    "and previous treatment response. The patient's risk stratification should be reassessed in a multidisciplinary tumor board setting to inform\n",
    "the management plan, which may include additional localized treatments or systemic therapy. Management of TSH levels according to current\n",
    "guidelines for persistent disease and monitoring for potential complications from treatment will also be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: GPT recognized the recurrent cancer and appropriately recommended surgery. However, GPT did not identify the correct operation to perform.\n",
    "\"Lymph node dissection\" is a generic term that doesn't give us any information about what the actual operation is to be performed.\n",
    "The correct answer is \"Right lateral neck dissection\" - this gives us the laterality and also the type of lymph node excision we will do.\n",
    "Lateral neck dissection is a specific term that denotes exactly what neck compartments are going to be explored and emptied of all their\n",
    "lymph node pockets. Please be specific when suggesting operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT did not review the risks of the procedure. Especially as this is considered a reoperation because we will have to go back into a\n",
    "previously operated field, the risks are significantly higher and need to be reviewed with the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "Assistant: I believe that our patient has thyroid nodules suspicious for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Given their Bethesda Category V fine-needle\n",
    "aspiration result and sonographic features of the nodule being solid, hypoechoic with microcalcifications, and classified as ATA high risk,\n",
    "I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This recommendation aligns with guidelines for suspicious nodules of significant\n",
    "size with high-risk features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, they will require postoperative surveillance, which may include measurement of thyroglobulin to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease,\n",
    "and periodic neck ultrasound. If papillary thyroid carcinoma is confirmed by the final pathology, additional treatments such as radioactive iodine ablation\n",
    "may need to be considered based on the staging and risk stratification. Regular follow-up to ensure euthyroid status and to monitor for recurrence will also\n",
    "be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: You chose the wrong operation (total thyroidectomy) because you saw the term ATA high risk classification. When risk stratification is mentioned it is important to determine whether it is regarding the imaging risk stratification versus histopathologic risk stratification. If “ATA risk” stratification is reported under “Ultrasound” or “imaging” then it should assume thats in reference to the imaging risk stratification system. If it the “ATA risk” is listed under “pathology” “histology” “histopathology” “biopsy” etc then it should be assumed that is referencing the histopathology risk stratification system.\n",
    "For this case, ATA High Risk was referring to imaging, so it would not automatically warrant a total thyroidectomy and a right thyroid lobectomy would be\n",
    "the correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4:\n",
    "If you recommend a total thyroidectomy, you should also recommend thyroid hormone supplementation as part of the follow-up plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 5:\n",
    "You do not need to monitor thyroglobulin for a patient with thyroid lobectomy. Thyroglobulin is a marker of thyroid tissue and only if the thyroid is removed\n",
    "then there should be no thyroglobulin to monitor. You also don't do radioactive iodine for lobectomy. These are only useful if there is no thyroid tissue left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 6:\n",
    "Please be specific when suggesting an operation. It is not enough to say resection, you have to specify the type of resection (e.g. thyroid lobectomy vs. total thyroidectomy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 7:\n",
    "Clinical vignette included a patient with a large nodule with subclinical hyperthyroidism. In its diagnosis, the GPT's assessment only mentioned \"benign thyroid nodule\" without mention of the hyperthyroidism which is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 8:\n",
    "Clinical vignette included a patient with a benign nodule but reported symptoms of dysphagia and voice change. The GPT recommended surveillance instead of surgery. For patients with compressive symptoms secondary to a nodule, surgery should be offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 9:\n",
    "A clinical vignette included FNA results demonstrating PTC in both a thyroid nodule and lymph nodes. The GPT's diagnosis was just \"Papillary thyroid cancer\" but it should have mentioned that this is \"metastatic papillary thyroid cancer\".\n",

      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with compressive symptoms. Given their history of progressive enlargement of the right thyroid lobe and symptoms of dysphagia and neck fullness, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require preoperative imaging, such as a CT scan, to evaluate the extent of the goiter, particularly to assess any potential retrosternal extension. Postoperatively, the patient will need thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests will be important to monitor for recurrence or other complications.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has multiple thyroid nodules, including at least one suspicious for malignancy (TIRADS 4). Given their history of radiation exposure, non-diagnostic FNA results, and symptoms of pooling saliva, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy to achieve a definitive diagnosis and manage the suspicious nodule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "- Preoperative neck ultrasound to evaluate the nodules and ensure no new suspicious lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "- Postoperative histopathological examination of the excised tissue to determine the presence or absence of malignancy.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasound and thyroid function tests to monitor for recurrence or the development of new nodules.\n",
      "- If malignancy is confirmed, further treatment options such as completion thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on the final histopathologic findings and staging.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up to ensure euthyroid status and to monitor for recurrence will also be important.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has thyroid nodules suspicious for malignancy. Given their TI-RADS 4 classification, which indicates an intermediate suspicion of malignancy, I believe that they would benefit from a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the right posterior upper pole nodule and the left midpole nodule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require close follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor for any changes in nodule size or characteristics. If the FNA results indicate malignancy, further treatment options such as a right thyroid lobectomy or total thyroidectomy, depending on the extent of disease, and possibly radioactive iodine ablation should be considered based on the final histopathologic findings. Regular follow-up to ensure euthyroid status and surveillance for recurrence or development of new nodules will also be important.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid nodule classified as Bethesda Category III. Given their significant nodule size (47x22x41mm) and its documented growth, I believe that they would benefit from a left thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative thyroid function tests and a comprehensive neck ultrasound to confirm no changes in lymph node status. Postoperatively, the patient will need surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor the remaining thyroid tissue, and regular thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status. Regular follow-up to monitor for any recurrence or development of new nodules or symptoms will also be important.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has benign multinodular goiter. Given their large nodule sizes (notably the 3.5 cm left midpole nodule and the 3.3 cm isthmus nodule), Bethesda Category II biopsy results, and the patient's advanced age and comorbidities, I believe that they would benefit from active surveillance rather than immediate surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years to monitor for any changes in nodule size or characteristics. Thyroid function tests should be conducted periodically to ensure euthyroid status. If any nodule demonstrates significant growth, suspicious features, or if the patient develops new symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or dysphonia, surgical intervention may be reconsidered.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter. Given their history of nodules with asymmetric enlargement of the right thyroid lobe causing tracheal deviation, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This approach is recommended due to the compressive symptoms and the presence of multiple nodules in both thyroid lobes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative CT scan of the neck to further evaluate the extent of the goiter and its relationship to surrounding structures. Postoperatively, the patient will need thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests will be important to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. Given their biopsy results showing atypical follicular cells and a BRAF+ mutation in the right level IV lymph node, along with the suspicious ultrasound features and symptoms of dysphagia, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy with right lateral neck dissection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative workup including serum TSH measurement and a CT scan of the neck to evaluate the extent of the disease. Postoperatively, they will need radioactive iodine ablation, ongoing surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds, and serum thyroglobulin measurements to monitor for residual or recurrent disease. Regular follow-up appointments will be essential to manage thyroid hormone replacement therapy, ensure euthyroid status, and monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid cancer in the context of a toxic multinodular goiter. Given their biopsy results with Bethesda Category V classification, positive ThyroSeq v3 with BRAF mutation, and the sonographic features indicating a high-risk nodule (TR5), I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require preoperative imaging, such as a CT scan, to evaluate the extent of the goiter and any potential substernal extension. Postoperative management will include lifelong thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status, measurement of thyroglobulin to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease, and periodic neck ultrasound. Radioactive iodine ablation may be considered based on the final histopathologic findings and staging. Regular follow-up to ensure appropriate thyroid hormone levels and to monitor for recurrence will also be crucial.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid cancer with potential cervical lymph node involvement. Given their Bethesda Category VI fine-needle aspiration result, the sonographic features of the nodule being solid, hypoechoic with microcalcifications, classified as TIRADS 5, and the incidental findings of multiple large cervical lymph nodes in the left neck, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy with central and left lateral neck dissection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative imaging, such as a CT scan of the neck, to evaluate the extent of the disease and the involvement of cervical lymph nodes. Postoperatively, they will need surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds and measurement of thyroglobulin levels to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease. Radioactive iodine ablation should be considered based on final histopathologic findings and staging. Regular follow-up visits will be necessary to ensure euthyroid status and to monitor for recurrence. Postoperative thyroid hormone supplementation will be required to maintain euthyroid status.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid nodule with compressive symptoms. Given their symptoms of neck pressure, choking sensation when lying flat, and food sticking in the throat, along with the increase in nodule size to 3.4 cm and repeated Bethesda III cytology, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative imaging, such as a CT scan or comprehensive neck ultrasound, to evaluate the extent of the nodule and its anatomical relationships. Postoperatively, thyroid function tests should be conducted to monitor for hypothyroidism and determine the need for levothyroxine supplementation. Regular follow-up visits with periodic neck ultrasounds will be necessary to monitor the remaining thyroid tissue and check for any recurrence or development of new nodules.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid nodule. Given their interval growth of the dominant nodule, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a pre-operative workup including routine blood tests and a repeat thyroid ultrasound to confirm the current size and characteristics of the nodule. Postoperatively, the patient should be monitored for hypothyroidism and may require thyroid hormone supplementation. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds will be important to monitor for recurrence or development of new nodules. Additionally, managing their osteopenia with appropriate supplementation or treatment, including consideration of a DXA scan, will be necessary.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with benign-appearing and moderately suspicious thyroid nodules in the left thyroid lobe. Given their history of right thyroid lobectomy in 2018 for a large goiter and the findings on recent imaging, I believe that they would benefit from a left thyroid lobectomy. This approach is warranted due to the presence of a moderately suspicious nodule (1.6 cm) that meets the criteria for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) but given the patient's history and the need for definitive management, surgical removal is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the patient will require a preoperative workup including vocal cord assessment to evaluate for any potential recurrent laryngeal nerve compromise from previous surgery. Postoperative management should include thyroid hormone replacement therapy to maintain euthyroid status, as the patient will be rendered athyroid following the completion of the thyroidectomy. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and measurements of thyroglobulin levels will be necessary to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a hyperfunctioning (toxic) thyroid nodule in the left thyroid lobe. Given their symptoms of food sticking in the throat, the hyperthyroidism confirmed by a low TSH level, and the imaging findings of a large (3.2 cm) mixed solid and cystic hypoechoic \"hot\" nodule in the left thyroid lobe, I believe they would benefit from a left thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative evaluation including thyroid function tests, complete blood count, coagulation profile, comprehensive metabolic panel, and possibly a CT scan of the neck to evaluate the extent of the nodule and any potential compressive symptoms. Postoperatively, the patient should be monitored with thyroid function tests to assess the need for thyroid hormone supplementation and to ensure euthyroid status. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds may also be necessary to monitor the remaining thyroid tissue.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid carcinoma. Given their biopsy results indicating malignancy (Bethesda Category VI) and ultrasound findings of a TR-5 nodule with possible effacement of the strap muscles and an indeterminate enlarged right level III lymph node, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the indeterminate right level III lymph node to assess for metastatic disease. Postoperatively, the patient will need radioactive iodine ablation depending on the final pathology and staging, measurement of thyroglobulin levels for surveillance, and periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor for recurrence. Thyroid hormone supplementation will also be necessary to maintain euthyroid status. Regular follow-up with endocrinology to manage hormone levels and monitor for any signs of recurrence will be essential.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with a follicular lesion of undetermined significance (Bethesda Category III). Given their ultrasound findings indicating a TR5 nodule in the right upper lobe, a TR4 nodule in the left lower lobe, and the FNA result of a follicular lesion of undetermined significance, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy. This approach aligns with the need to manage suspicious nodules effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require postoperative surveillance, including periodic neck ultrasound to monitor for recurrence or new nodule development, and follow-up thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status. If the final pathology confirms malignancy, further treatment options such as completion thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on staging and risk stratification.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid carcinoma with multiple malignant nodules. Given their biopsy results indicating Bethesda Category VI for malignancy in multiple thyroid nodules, and the ultrasound findings showing high suspicion features such as irregular margins and microcalcifications, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative workup including a comprehensive neck ultrasound to assess the extent of the disease, particularly looking for any suspicious lymph nodes, and an evaluation of vocal cord function due to the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Postoperatively, they will need thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status. Surveillance will involve periodic neck ultrasounds and measurement of thyroglobulin levels to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease. Given the patient's pregnancy, careful coordination with her obstetrician is essential to optimize fetal and maternal outcomes. Further treatment with radioactive iodine therapy may be considered postpartum based on final pathology and staging. Regular follow-up to manage TSH levels and monitor for recurrence will also be necessary.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a thyroid nodule classified as Bethesda III: atypia of unknown significance (AUS)/follicular lesion of unknown significance (FLUS). Given their positive DICER1 mutation and TIRADS 4 ultrasound result, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy. This approach is recommended for indeterminate nodules with molecular markers suggesting a higher risk for malignancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require postoperative surveillance, including periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease and thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status. If the final pathology confirms malignancy, further treatment options such as completion thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on staging and risk stratification. Regular follow-up appointments will also be important to monitor for recurrence or the development of new nodules.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a follicular neoplasm in the left isthmic nodule. Given their symptoms of phlegm and food sticking in their throat, and the Bethesda IV cytology result, I believe that they would benefit from a left thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require preoperative molecular profiling to assess for potential mutations that may influence further management. Postoperatively, they will need surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status and monitor for any recurrence or development of new nodules. The final pathology will determine if additional treatments, such as completion thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation, will be necessary based on the presence and extent of malignancy. Regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence or new symptoms will also be important.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has suspicious thyroid nodules with features concerning for malignancy. Given their history of hyperthyroidism and the ultrasound findings of TR4 nodules in the right midpole, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy. This approach is recommended due to the suspicious characteristics of the nodules, including being hypoechoic, having macrocalcifications, and being \"wider than tall,\" which warrant surgical intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the suspicious nodules to confirm cytology. Postoperatively, they will need periodic follow-up with neck ultrasound and thyroid function tests to monitor for any recurrence and ensure euthyroid status. If the pathology confirms malignancy, further treatment options such as completion thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on final histopathologic findings and staging. Regular follow-up in the form of physical exams and possibly serum thyroglobulin measurement will also be important for ongoing surveillance.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with moderately suspicious nodules. Given the presence of a moderately suspicious nodule in the left lower pole that is 4.9 x 3.1 x 3.1 cm, I believe that they would benefit from a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of this nodule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require close follow-up and surveillance, including periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor the nodules for any changes in size or characteristics. Given the patient's subnormal TSH levels, a radionuclide thyroid scan should also be obtained to assess if any of the nodules are hyperfunctioning. Further management, including potential surgical intervention, will be guided by the FNA biopsy results and thyroid scan findings.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with a suspicious right lower lobe nodule. Given their Bethesda Category IV fine-needle aspiration (FNA) result for the right lower lobe nodule, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "1. Preoperative imaging, including a CT scan, to evaluate the extent of the goiter and any potential substernal extension.\n",
      "2. Postoperative pathology review to determine the presence of malignancy and guide further treatment if necessary.\n",
      "3. Postoperative surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests to monitor for recurrence or the development of new nodules.\n",
      "4. If malignancy is confirmed in the final pathology, additional treatment options such as completion thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on the final histopathologic findings and staging.\n",
      "5. Regular follow-up to ensure euthyroid status and to monitor for any postoperative complications.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid nodule. Given their previous right thyroidectomy and the recent ultrasound findings showing a 2.9 cm mixed cystic and solid nodule in the left thyroid lobe with an ACR TI-RADS score of TR2 (not suspicious), I believe that they would benefit from surveillance rather than immediate intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require periodic follow-up with neck ultrasounds to monitor the nodule for any changes in size or characteristics. Given the patient's history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it is important to perform regular thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status. Vitamin D supplementation should also be considered due to their low levels. Any new symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or dysphonia should prompt re-evaluation.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid pseudonodule. Given their ultrasound findings indicating no discrete thyroid nodules and the stable presentation of a previously noted pseudonodule, I believe that they would benefit from continued observation rather than surgical intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds at 1, 3, and 5 years to monitor for any changes in the thyroid gland or the development of new nodules. Continued management of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and monitoring of thyroid function tests should also be maintained. Regular clinical evaluations, including annual physical exams and symptom assessments, will be important to ensure optimal thyroid health and early detection of any potential issues.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has primary hyperparathyroidism with a mildly suspicious left lateral thyroid nodule. Given their elevated calcium levels, elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and the interval growth of the left lateral thyroid nodule, I believe that they would benefit from a left thyroid lobectomy and left parathyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative localization studies for the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland, such as a sestamibi scan or 4D-CT. Postoperatively, they will need serum calcium and PTH monitoring to ensure resolution of hyperparathyroidism. Surveillance of the remaining thyroid tissue with periodic neck ultrasound and monitoring of thyroid function tests will also be important. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor for any recurrence or development of new symptoms. Coordination with her oncologist and other specialists will be important to manage her overall health and medication interactions.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid nodule with compressive symptoms. Given their symptoms of dysphagia and the nodule size of 4.4 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a pre-operative workup, including a neck ultrasound and possibly a CT scan to evaluate the extent of the nodule and its relationship to surrounding structures. Postoperatively, they will need surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests to monitor for any recurrence or development of new nodules. Regular follow-up appointments to assess thyroid hormone levels and clinical symptoms will also be important to ensure the patient remains euthyroid and symptom-free.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a follicular neoplasm. Given their Bethesda Category IV fine-needle aspiration result, the significant size of the right thyroid nodule (35 x 23 x 24 mm), and the risk of malignancy (40-50%), I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative evaluation including a repeat ultrasound to confirm the nodule's characteristics and assess for any potential lymph node involvement. Postoperatively, surveillance will include periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests to monitor for recurrence or development of new nodules. If malignancy is confirmed on final pathology, further treatment options such as completion thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on staging and risk stratification. Regular follow-up to ensure euthyroid status and to monitor for any recurrence will be essential.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter. Given their significant nodule sizes, particularly the left mid nodule measuring 83 x 36 x 71 mm and the left upper nodule measuring 52 x 27 x 44 mm, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This approach is recommended for patients with large bilateral nodular disease to address potential compressive symptoms and prevent future complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative CT scan of the neck and chest to evaluate the extent of the goiter and check for any substernal extension or tracheal deviation. Postoperatively, the patient will need thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests will be necessary to monitor for any recurrence and ensure appropriate hormone replacement levels.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid cancer. Given their Bethesda VI cytology result from the right upper nodule and the presence of suspicious cervical lymph nodes, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "1. A thorough preoperative evaluation including a comprehensive neck ultrasound to delineate the extent of the disease and assess for any additional suspicious lymph nodes.\n",
      "2. Postoperative radioactive iodine ablation therapy to address any residual thyroid tissue or microscopic disease.\n",
      "3. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and serum thyroglobulin measurements to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "4. Lifelong thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status and suppress TSH to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with a low-risk thyroid nodule. Given their incidental findings on MRI and subsequent ultrasound confirmation, I believe that they would benefit from surveillance rather than immediate surgical intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require periodic follow-up with neck ultrasound to monitor for any changes in the size or characteristics of the nodules. Thyroid function tests should be monitored periodically to ensure euthyroid status. If any nodule demonstrates significant growth or develops suspicious features, a repeat fine-needle aspiration biopsy will be indicated.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with compressive symptoms and potential malignancy. Given their symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia, and a firm thyroid nodule, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "1. A preoperative CT scan to evaluate the extent of the goiter and any substernal extension.\n",

      "3. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and measurement of serum thyroglobulin to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease.\n",
      "4. Pathology review of the excised thyroid tissue to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy. If malignancy is confirmed, further treatment options such as radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on staging and risk stratification.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter. Given their history of multiple nodules with varying sizes, mixed cystic and solid components, and evidence of growth over time, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This approach is recommended for patients with bilateral nodular disease and significant nodule growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "1. Preoperative imaging, such as a CT scan, to evaluate the extent of the goiter and to check for any potential substernal extension.\n",
      "2. Postoperative thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status.\n",
      "3. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any complications or recurrence, including periodic neck ultrasounds and measurement of serum thyroglobulin levels.\n",
      "4. Monitoring of serum calcium levels postoperatively to detect and manage potential hypocalcemia.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma. Given their fine-needle aspiration results—Bethesda VI (malignant) for the right mid-lower nodule and Bethesda V (suspicious for malignancy) for the left mid nodule—I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "- Preoperative neck ultrasound to evaluate for any additional suspicious lymph nodes.\n",
      "- Postoperative surveillance, including measurement of serum thyroglobulin and periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor for residual or recurrent disease.\n",
      "- Consideration of radioactive iodine ablation therapy based on final pathology and staging.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require postoperative surveillance, which may include periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests to monitor for recurrence and ensure euthyroid status. If the final pathology confirms malignancy, further treatment options, such as completion thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation, may need to be considered based on the histopathologic findings and staging. Regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence and manage long-term outcomes will also be important.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a benign thyroid nodule. Given their nodule size of 41 x 35 x 29 mm and the absence of suspicious sonographic features, I believe that they would benefit from a left thyroid lobectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative workup, including a repeat neck ultrasound to confirm the current status of the nodule and assess for any new findings. Postoperative care will include thyroid function tests to monitor for hypothyroidism and appropriate thyroid hormone supplementation if needed. Regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor the remaining thyroid lobe for any new nodules or changes will also be important.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has multinodular goiter with compressive symptoms. Given their symptoms of neck pressure and hoarseness, as well as the presence of multiple thyroid nodules, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This approach is recommended due to the compressive symptoms and the presence of multiple nodules across both thyroid lobes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require preoperative imaging with a CT scan to evaluate the extent of the goiter and its relationship to surrounding structures. Postoperatively, the patient will require thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain euthyroid status. Regular follow-up will include periodic TSH monitoring to adjust thyroid hormone replacement therapy and measurements of serum calcium levels to monitor for hypocalcemia. Clinical monitoring for recurrence of compressive symptoms is also advisable.\n",

Postoperatively, the patient will need thyroid hormone supplementation and regular follow-up with periodic neck ultrasounds and measurement of serum thyroglobulin to monitor for any residual or recurrent disease. If the final pathology reveals malignancy, further treatment options such as radioactive iodine ablation may need to be considered based on staging and risk stratification.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter with mildly to moderately suspicious thyroid nodules. Given their ultrasound findings and the absence of significant compressive symptoms or suspicious cervical lymphadenopathy, I believe that they would benefit from surveillance rather than immediate fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) or surgery at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with neck ultrasound at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years to monitor for any changes in size or characteristics of the nodules.\n",
      "- Routine surveillance of thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status.\n",
      "- Monitoring of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels due to the patient's history of elevated calcium levels, to rule out primary hyperparathyroidism.\n",
      "- Patient education on the symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and potential malignancy, advising them to report any new symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or dysphonia immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any nodules grow beyond the size thresholds for FNA or develop suspicious features, further diagnostic evaluation may be warranted.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a thyroid nodule with indeterminate cytology (Bethesda Category III) and a DICER mutation, indicating a 50% risk of malignancy. Given their nodule's significant growth in size and the genetic mutation associated with a higher risk of malignancy, I believe that they would benefit from a right thyroid lobectomy with isthmectomy.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require a preoperative neck CT scan to evaluate the extent of the goiter, potential tracheal deviation, and any substernal extension. Postoperatively, the patient will need surveillance with periodic neck ultrasounds to monitor the remaining thyroid tissue and follow-up thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status. If any significant pathology is noted on the final histopathological examination, further management such as completion thyroidectomy or additional treatment may need to be considered based on the findings.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has a toxic multinodular goiter. Given their subclinical hyperthyroidism, suppressed TSH levels, and the presence of large nodules, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy. This approach is recommended due to the significant size of the nodules, the presence of hyperthyroidism, and the compressive symptoms such as dyspnea.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require preoperative imaging with a CT scan to evaluate the extent of the goiter and its impact on surrounding structures, including any potential substernal extension.

Regular follow-up, including periodic neck ultrasounds and measurements of thyroid function tests, will be important to monitor for recurrence or complications.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid cancer with an NTRK3 fusion. Given their significant compressive symptoms (dysphonia and throat swelling) and the biopsy results indicating a high risk of malignancy (ROM >95%), I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require:\n",

Postoperatively, they will need periodic neck ultrasounds and thyroid function tests to monitor for recurrence or the development of new nodules. If the final pathology reveals malignancy, further treatments such as completion thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation may be considered based on staging and risk stratification. Regular follow-up will be necessary to ensure the patient remains euthyroid and to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "I believe that our patient has metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. Given their biopsy results confirming papillary thyroid carcinoma in both the 3.1 cm and 1.4 cm nodules in the right thyroid lobe, along with symptoms of hoarseness, I believe that they would benefit from a total thyroidectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they will require pre-operative imaging to evaluate for potential metastasis and vocal cord assessment to document baseline vocal cord function. Postoperatively, they will need radioactive iodine ablation to eliminate any residual thyroid tissue or microscopic disease. Surveillance will include periodic neck ultrasounds and measurement of thyroglobulin levels to monitor for recurrence.
