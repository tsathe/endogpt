Thyroid Nodule Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy:
Patient reports several benign biopsies, most recently about 1.5 years ago.","I believe that our patient has a thyroid nodule.  We reviewed the options for management of benign thyroid nodules including observation, ultrasound guided radiofrequency or ethanol ablation, or surgical excision..  Given her  large symptomatic nodule , I believe that she would benefit from an intervention.  We discussed a completion thyroidectomy as the most definitive option. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as her specific risk profile.  She understands that she will require thyroid hormone supplementation. I explained that the operation will be done under general anesthesia to allow for nerve monitoring.  Alternatively, I believe that the patient is also a good candidate for ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the details of this procedure performed in an outpatient setting without the need for general anesthesia,  and the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to surgical resection. These include a similar low risk of infection, bleeding, and nerve injury. There is an increased risk for recurrence, but lower risk for thyroid hormone dependency. We also reviewed the more rare complications including nodule rupture, skin burn, or tracheal injury.  This procedure does not preclude additional ablation procedures or surgical resection in the future. In addition, the patient understands that this procedure is not a substitute for surgery, but is an alternative treatment for appropriate patients.  She would like to proceed with surgical excision. Prior to the operation, I've asked our patient to obtain a pre-operative risk assessment.  Thank you again for the privilege of participating in the care of your patient. I will keep in touch as we proceed, but please do not hesitate to call anytime"

If the cytology is concerning for malignancy, we would discuss proceeding with a lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy.  I have advised the patient hold any NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Aleve or Advil), aspirin or other blood thinners for 5 days, if their medical doctor agrees, prior to the biopsy.

We had a long discussion regarding thyroid nodules and how they are very common in the general population.  We reviewed options for management including continuing observation versus thyroidectomy.  We discussed that if the molecular testing resulted as suspicious I would definitely recommend thyroidectomy.  However, she reported that her symptoms are bothersome enough that she would like to pursue surgery even if the molecular testing is benign.  Given her large, symptomatic nodule, I believe that she would benefit from an operation. We discussed lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy and given that she is already taking thyroid hormone replacement and she would like to avoid the possibility of another operation, she would like to proceed with a total thyroidectomy. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as her specific risk profile.

Pathology: Thyroid Nodule Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy: No previous biopsies","I believe that our patient has a toxic adenoma. Given her large, symptomatic nodule and desire to maintain thyroid hormone production, I believe that she would benefit from Left thyroid lobectomy, nerve monitoring, and or ultrasound-guided thermal ablation. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as her specific risk profile.  She understands that she may need thyroid hormone supplementation. We also discussed that the operation would be performed under general anesthesia. Prior to the operation, she would require medical clearance.  Alternatively, I believe that the patient is also a good candidate for ultrasound guided thermal ablation. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the details of this procedure performed in an outpatient setting without the need for general anesthesia,  and the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to surgical resection. These include a similar low risk of infection, bleeding, and nerve injury. There is an increased risk for recurrence, but lower risk for thyroid hormone dependency. This procedure does not preclude additional ablation procedures or surgical resection in the future. The patient understands that this is a new procedure in the United States, but has been performed extensively internationally with good long term outcomes. We offer both radiofrequency and microwave ablation at our institution. For her nodule(s), I believe RFA would be the best approach. In addition, the patient understands that this procedure is not a substitute for surgery, but is an alternative treatment for appropriate patients. She will continue to contemplate her options and let us know how she would like to proceed. Thank you again for the privilege of seeing your patient.

Isthmus thickness: 5 mm 
No thyroid nodules 
Right mid area examined where her nodule was previously measured (3/2024 
and 8/2022), in the sagittal view I can appreciate was was measured 
previously however in the dynamic view, this does not appear to be a 
discrete nodule and in the transverse view it is even less obvious.  This 
appears to be heterogeneous thyroid at the level of the tubercle rather 
than a discrete nodule, especially since the rest of her thyroid has a 
similar heterogeneous appearance 
No suspicious cervical lymphadenopathy 
No abnormal parathyroid identified 
IMPRESSION and RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No discrete thyroid nodules appreciated. Area of concern reviewed, most 
consistent with a right mid pseudonodule at the level of the tubercle.  
Pathology:

no previous thyroid biopsies","I believe that our patient has a thyroid pseudonodule.  We reviewed in detail that the area of concern in the right mid lobe does not appear to be a discrete nodule in the dynamic view.  We reviewed her prior images and compared to her current ultrasound and discussed that this area has remained stable and again does not appear to have distinct borders.  I would recommend observation of this area, if there is growth or a nodule becomes more discrete we can reconsider fine needle aspiration biopsy.  We discussed the potential downsides of proceeding with a biopsy anyway including the possibility of an insufficient sample, especially given the very small size and posterior position of this area in the transverse view.

ATYPIA OF UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE (AUS) – Bethesda Category III. 
Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier:  Benign ","I believe that our patient has multiple thyroid nodules and primary hyperparathyroidism.  Given her interval growth of the left thyroid nodule, I believe that she would benefit from a repeat fine needle aspiration biopsy. We had a long discussion regarding the range of possible results of a thyroid nodule biopsy as well as the recommended next steps.  If the cytology is benign, I recommend a follow up ultrasound in 6 months - 1 year.  If the cytology is indeterminate, I would recommend sending for further analysis with molecular profiling.  If the cytology is concerning for malignancy, we would discuss proceeding with a lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy.  I have advised the patient hold any NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Aleve or Advil), aspirin or other blood thinners for 5 days, if their medical doctor agrees, prior to the biopsy.  I should have the biopsy results several days after the procedure and will be in touch with the findings. We also discussed her primary hyperparathyroidism given her biochemical diagnosis.  We reviewed that she currently does not have any criteria that warrant an operation but if she does develop progressive disease we can discuss parathyroidectomy.  The patient expressed understanding and is in agreement with the plan. Thank you again for the privilege of participating in the care of your patient. I will keep in touch as we proceed, but please do not hesitate to call anytime"

 Note: While this specimen may represent a hyperplastic/ adenomatoid nodule of thyroid, the presence of oncocytic features in most follicular cells present are worrisome; a follicular neoplasm with oncocytic features cannot be excluded in this specimen. Recommend repeat fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance, after an appropriate time interval (at least 3 months after original biopsy, in order to avoid post-FNA reparative cellular atypia), for better characterization, if clinically applicable

 BENIGN FINDINGS – Bethesda Category II ","I believe that our patient has a multinodular goiter.  We had a long discussion regarding thyroid nodules and how they are very common in the general population.   We reviewed the options for management of benign thyroid nodules including observation or surgical excision.  We discussed that it is likely that her thyroid is contributing to her dysphagia but it may not be solely responsible and thus may not completely resolve after a thyroidectomy.  If her symptoms are significantly bothersome we discussed proceeding with a right lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy.  We discussed advantages of a lobectomy compared to a total thyroidectomy including the possibility that she could avoid thyroid hormone replacement.  However, we discussed that if she only proceeded with a lobectomy there is a possibility she would still need thyroid hormone medication and a possible completion thyroidectomy at some point.  She expressed understanding and would like to discuss further with her family.  She will call and let us know if she decides she would like to pursue surgery and whether she prefers a lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy.

INTERPRETATION: 
    NON-DIAGNOSTIC – Bethesda Category I","I believe that our patient has a non-toxic multinodular goiter. Given his  enlarged, heterogeneous bilateral goiter with relatively small nodules and his increasing compressive symptoms , I believe that he would benefit from Total thyroidectomy and nerve monitoring. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as his specific risk profile.  He understands that he will require thyroid hormone supplementation. Prior to the operation, I've asked our patient to obtain a medical clearance.  We also discussed that the operation would be performed under general anesthesia. Prior to the operation, he would require medical clearance.  Since we do not have any imaging since 2022, I have asked him to obtain a CT neck to assist in operative planning. Thank you again for the privilege of seeing your patient.

We discussed the indications, risks, alternatives, and benefits of the fine needle aspiration biopsy and the details of the procedure. I will first perform a diagnostic ultrasound to confirm the presence and characteristics of the nodule(s) in question. If I agree that a biopsy is warranted, I will apply topical lidocaine on the skin, and then I will insert a 25 gauge needle into the nodule(s) under ultrasound guidance to collect cells. On average, each nodule takes an average of 3 passes for cellular sufficiency. There are no restrictions coming into or leaving the biopsy, though we ask patients to stop any blood thinning medications like aspirin, coumadin, or plavix for 5 days prior to the biopsy.

In the left mid and posterior lobe, a nodule is identified measuring  19 x 
8 x 14mm. It is complex with interspersed cystic spaces and hypoechoic  
has smooth borders is heterogeneous  and has no echogenic foci  (ATA low 
risk). 
In the left isthmic lobe, a nodule is identified measuring  22 x 14 x 
20mm. It is complex and largely cystic  has smooth borders is 
heterogeneous  and has echogenic foci consistent with a colloid crystals  
(ATA low risk). 
Additional subcentimeter, benign appearing nodules in the right lobe(s) 
There was no suspicious cervical lymphadenopathy identified. 
IMPRESSION and RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Multinodular goiter. 
Thyroid Nodule Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy:
no previous thyroid biopsies","I believe that our patient has a non-toxic multinodular goiter. Given her characteristics of the nodule(s), I believe that she would benefit from a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the dominant nodule(s). We discussed the indications, risks, alternatives, and benefits of the fine needle aspiration biopsy and the details of the procedure. I will first perform a diagnostic ultrasound to confirm the presence and characteristics of the nodule(s) in question. If I agree that a biopsy is warranted, I will apply topical lidocaine on the skin, and then I will insert a 25 gauge needle into the nodule(s) under ultrasound guidance to collect cells. On average, each nodule takes an average of 3 passes for cellular sufficiency. There are no restrictions coming into or leaving the biopsy, though we ask patients to stop any blood thinning medications like aspirin, coumadin, or plavix for 5 days prior to the biopsy. We also discussed the potential results of the biopsy: 1) benign 2) indeterminate and 3) malignant, each with their own risk of malignancy and recommended following steps.   I should have the biopsy results in a few days and will be in touch with the findings. Thank you again for the privilege of seeing your patient. I will keep in touch as we proceed, but please do not hesitate to call anytime.."

The patient expressed again that she really wanted to avoid surgery and was hoping that she could have the radiofrequency ablation.  I discussed with her that we do not offer radiofrequency ablation for patients with positive molecular testing given the elevated risk of cancer and the unpredictability of the lesion, as well as the difficulty of following the lesion in the setting of post ablation changes.  We reviewed the benefits of a lobectomy compared to a total thyroidectomy including the possibility of avoiding thyroid hormone replacement.  She understands that there is a chance she may still need thyroid hormone replacement as well as possibly a completion thyroidectomy in the future. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as her specific risk profile.  I explained that the operation will be done under general anesthesia to allow for nerve monitoring. Prior to the operation, I've asked our patient to obtain a pre-operative risk assessment.

Given her risk for malignancy, I believe that she would benefit from Right thyroid lobectomy. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as her specific risk profile.  She understands that she may need thyroid hormone supplementation. She understands that she may need a completion thyroidectomy in the future. Prior to the operation, I've asked our patient to obtain a pre-operative evaluation.  Given that she is in her third trimester, we discussed the pro's and con's of waiting until she is post-partum vs proceeding now and we all agree with you that we should wait until she has delivered.  We'll also repeat an US pre-op.  Thank you again for the privilege of seeing your patient. I will keep in touch as we proceed, but please do not hesitate to call anytime.."

Left neck soft tissue: papillary thyroid carcinoma involving 3 of 6 lmyph nodes","I believe that our patient has metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. Given her  metastatic papillary thyroid cancer , I believe that she would benefit from Total thyroidectomy, Bilateral central neck dissection, completion left lateral neck dissection, nerve monitoring, and intraoperative neck ultrasound. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, bleeding, thoracic duct injury/chyle leak, and injury to the hypoglossal/phrenic/vagus/spinal accessory/sympathetic trunk nerves as well as her specific risk profile.  Given the recency of her prior neck operation, she understands that the risks are higher and that she should prioritize safety over removing every single node.  I have asked her to have a lymph node mapping today to determine what disease is left.  She understands that she will require thyroid hormone supplementation. I believe she is in good hands with Dr. Caruana but I am happy to help in any way. Thank you again for the privilege of seeing your patient.

Thyroid Nodule Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy 01/2024:
Left 1.5 cm Bethesda VI positive for malignancy","I believe that our patient has papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.  We had a long discussion regarding papillary thyroid carcinoma and the excellent prognosis. We reviewed the options for management of papillary microcarcinoma including active surveillance, ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation, or surgical excision..   In her case, given that it is close to the border of the nodule and in the tracheoesophageal groove I would recommend surgical excision. We reviewed the option of lobectomy compared to a total thyroidectomy  but given that she is already on thyroid hormone replacement, she would like to avoid the possibility of another operation and would like to proceed with a total thyroidectomy. I discussed at length the risks, benefits, and indications of this operation including but not limited to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and bleeding as well as her specific risk profile.  She understands that she will continue to require thyroid hormone supplementation. I explained that the operation will be done under general anesthesia to allow for nerve monitoring. Prior to the operation, I've asked our patient to obtain a pre-operative testing including bloodwork.  The patient expressed understanding and is in agreement with the plan.
